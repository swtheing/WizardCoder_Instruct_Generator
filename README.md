# WizardCoder_Instruct_Generator
- You need to write the completeion function by openAI api, which recieves the prompt and output the GPT4 response.
- The final output is saved in new_code_demo.json.
- I give a demo in new_code_demo.json, you need to rerun 3-4 times of generate_evloveinstruct.py to generate the instructs, fine-tune your model and  find the best performance on Human-eval, which is the same as the paper "Wizarder-Coder".
